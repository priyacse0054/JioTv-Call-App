# JioTv-Call-App

This a Video and Audio call App for Android Tv and Mobile Phone. Where user can make HD Calls using the Jio Camera(which is plug-in and use device) and Mic. Every user will be having a FLN(Fixed line number) and the user can make video call to any other fiber user or to any other Jio mobile number.  Also users who is not having the camera device in TV. With the help  of Java socket we are giving mobile camera amd mic access on the Tv and captureing the frames and audio buffers from the mobile mic and passing to the Tv app to transfer it to other.

Role - My main Role is to work on the Audio part of the calling App and some part of UI and Video.
